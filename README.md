## Project 4
In this project, I built a visualization inspired by [OurWorldInData's](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases) COVID-19 dashboard. The visualization is made up of two views: a map and a interactive line chart based on the selected countries in map.
Here is the final visualization showing the interaction between the world map and line chart,
